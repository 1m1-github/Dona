const ErrorHandling = """
If you see that the most previous `Action` resulted in an `Exception`, you should address it, not ignore it
Usually, you will want to be intentional, meaning if you tried to do something but failed, then you should keep retrying until it works or ask for help
If the command is too complex, suggest tools or sub-part solutions that if learned reliably would allow you to complete this entire task reliably
If you need clarifications, ask before doing all the work, we can converse for as long as we want to
Remember, reliability is key
Honesty is a must
